SECTION 1

Secretary: Hello how can I help you?

Man: Hi, I've just moved to the area and saw an advertisement for your Drama society, so I'm calling to find out some more details.

Secretary: Sure. I'm the society secretary. My name is Jane Caulfield.

Man: Thanks. Can you tell me exactly where the society is based?

Secretary: Well, the address for the society is my address, which is 117 Green Road, like the colour and that's in Prestwin. But that's just the mailing address. It's not where we actually rehearse. We do that at the Club House in Wynn. It's behind the playing fields. It used to be a Cricket Club, you see.

Man: Oh, right.

Secretary: So, is this a new interest or do you have some acting experience? It doesn't matter if you haven't, you know, experience isn't a requirement.

Man: Well, that's good because I haven't got any, but I am a musical and I've got some experience of song festivals.

Secretary: Oh, That's great. We're always looking for actors and singers, of course, especially male ones. Oh, by the way, do you have a car?

Man: Yes. Why?

Secretary: It's a big help if you're able to drive. Not all our members have access to transport, so it's very helpful.

Man: I see. Well, I'm sure I can help out there. So, when do you actually meet?

Secretary: On Tuesday from 6 to 8 pm?

Man: Sorry, you said Tuesday, not Thursday.

Secretary: Yes.

Man: Good, Thursdays are a problem for me. I do some private tutoring and can't move that.

Secretary: Right.

Man: And that's all year, no breaks?

Secretary: Good point. We do close for a couple of weeks, you know, in August so we don't get together then.

Before you hear the rest of the conversation, you have some time to look at questions 6 to 10. Now listen and answer questions 6 to 10.

Man: And is there a joining fee?

Secretary: To be a member costs just £40.

Man: A year?

Secretary: Yes, and that covers our annual dinner.

Man: Right.

Secretary: But there's a rate for concessions, which are for people over 60 and the unemployed.

Man: I've just retired, so that's good news. What's the discount? It was 10%, but now it's more. You pay just £25, which is a reduction of £15.

Man: Every little helps, after all, especially with a teenage son. Actually, I wanted to ask if there's an age limit, could Jack come along too? He's 15.

Secretary: Actually, we have a special youth group and that's open to anyone up to and including sixteen years old so he could join that?

Man: Great. Keep him out of trouble. And what about the shows you put on? You said you were very busy. Do you have plays, etcetera every year or how does it work?

Secretary: Well, we put on at least two productions a year. Occasionally we might do Shakespeare, but normally we choose works by modern playwrights.

Man: Sounds quite varied and challenging. And you rehearse for the two productions when you meet up?

Secretary: Certainly. But that's not all we do. We also write our own family show each winter for the December holidays, which is always a lot of fun and is actually very popular in the local community. We donate the money we make to the children's hospital here.

Man: Oh, that sounds very nice. I've been involved in charity work...

SECTION 2

Peter: Hello, my name's Peter Blakewell and I'm the owner of the strawberry farm. All of you are starting work here next week, so I thought it would be helpful if I explained a bit about the farm and what you'll be doing.

Well, the farm operates all year round, but summer is when we open to the public and people come here to pick their own strawberries as a family activity. It's also our busiest period, which is why we need you for the next few months.

Well, first up, what do you need to bring for a long day? You'll be working outside a lot, so fill up your water bottles at home and have them with you at all times. You'll come in for lunch around 1 o'clock. We'll be putting sandwiches out for you, and there's also short morning and afternoon breaks. Gloves should be worn at all times. You'll find them in the Packing shed. Just make sure they get returned, please.

Now, if for some reason you can't come into work, there's a procedure to follow. There's no point phoning the office. By the time someone picks up your message, it'll be too late to find a replacement. You need to get hold of the duty manager's phone and speak to him directly and he'll let your team leader know you're going to be off.

Before I forget, last year we had a problem with customers getting to the checkouts and not realising how much they have to pay per kilo for the strawberries. But we've got signs with price lists all round the farm this year, so that's being dealt with.

One annoying thing is people taking baskets out of the shop and leaving them in the car park, or worse, taking them home. They're expensive to replace, so please keep an eye on them. If you're in the fields, no doubt you'll see people popping a couple of strawberries into their mouths, but we don't need to worry about this too much.

I should mention the benefits of working here. For a start, you get to take home a good sized carton of strawberries at no charge. Your family members can also get 15% off the fruit they pick. Discounts don't apply to the gift shop, I'm afraid.

Before you hear the rest of the talk, you have some time to look at questions 15 to 20. Now listen and answer questions 15 to 20.

Alright, let's look at the map you all have to give you an idea of the farms layout. We'll start with the staff room. See the main building? The entrance is at the bottom of your map. Well, above the main building on the map is a row of three smaller buildings. The staff room is the middle one. If you need to go to administration, that's easy to find. In the main building you've got the three checkout desks in the bottom right hand corner and the cafe in the top corner, and the other large inside area is the shop. So administration is the other room there. It's in the top left hand corner.

Um, some of you were working in the packing shed. You see where the main building is and then at the top of the map. There are the round water tanks, four of them. The packing shed is the bigger of the two buildings, directly below the tanks on your map. Not easy work, but at least you'll be in the shade.

If you're driving to work, you'll need to know where the staff car park is. So that's to the left of the main building, the area nearest the bottom of the map. Park there and then either use the front entrance or that little door on the left of the main building.

Right. Let's talk about where the customers can and can't pick their own strawberries. They're not allowed to enter the commercial growing areas. And you can see area 1 already marked on your map. That means there are two sections where customers are allowed to pick their own fruit. The section with strawberries that are ready to pick now, the ripe strawberries. That's the L shape section right at the top of the map on the left. The unripe strawberries will be ready in about 3 weeks. So that section it's above commercial growing area 1 and you can see it from the cafe.

OK, so does anyone have any questions about?

SECTION 3

Lecturer: Hello, Mark and Stella. Last month you two went on a field trip to Bolton Island to look at the geography and geology of the island, didn't you?

Mark: Yes, we thought carefully before we chose Bolton. It's one of several similar islands off our west coast. All formed geologically about the same time, and...

Stella: Although it's been pretty thoroughly studied over the years.

Mark: There were regular ferries from the mainland, so that meant no hassles for us to get there.

Lecturer: Fair enough. In terms of physical geography, what did you focus on? Bolton's got some prominent rocks along its shore, hasn't it?

Stella: Yes, we considered those, but in the end they just seemed a bit too ordinary.

Mark: But the island's got a deep protected bay, which is perfect for boats to anchor in bad weather, so we decided to mainly look at that.

Stella: Actually, we're both interested in soil content. But to be honest, Bolton so rocky with such poor soil quality that practically no crops grow there.

Lecturer: And did you have any problems doing your physical geography observations? Any trouble getting your hands on published materials, official maps, government surveys, things like that?

Mark: No. In fact, we took along all that kind of helpful stuff with us.

Stella: But, you know, a lot of the time on the island, it wasn't always clear to us what were naturally occurring geological phenomena and what had been created by people. But in the end, I think we managed to sort most of our confusion out.

Mark: And luckily we were able to talk to residents who are knowledgeable about the past and what have been constructed over the years.

Lecturer: And what was the most useful thing you two did to prepare for your trip.

Mark: The first thing we did was to look at the Bolton Island website and that gave some information, but there wasn't a lot. We did have a general plan of what we wanted to do during our few days on the island, but we decided to leave our schedule open-ended to allow flexibility.

Stella: We also consulted lots of old student reports and I think we found that probably the best preparation.

Before you hear the rest of the discussion, you have some time to look at questions 25 to 30. Now listen and answer questions 25 to 30.

Lecturer: Now, you're going to talk to the students who want to do independent field trips next year to give them some advice. You must have taken photos and made sketches. Lots of students have problems with that. Did you make any mistakes? Anything you wish you'd done better with your visuals?

Stella: Well, some indication of the relative size of things in a photo needs to be made by, say, including a familiar object in the picture. Regrettably, we didn't think of that. We didn't waste time trying to make our sketches perfect. Crude drawings were fine. Sometimes the light wasn't very good for artistic photography, but the pictures came out perfectly usable.

Mark: But we didn't always remember to put all the important information on the drawings, like date, time, place and so on, and that information was hard to reconstruct later. I'm glad we never took more than one photo or made more than one sketch of any one thing. That save time.

Lecturer: What's your advice about interviews with locals?

Stella: Preparing questions ahead of time isn't helpful. The main thing is reassuring the interviewees, telling them in some detail what the project is about and what you need from them. And we never recorded our interviews. That seems counterproductive and can inhibit your subject. And although the interviewees are the experts, if they go off topic, you should politely bring them back to what you're interested in. But never show whether you agree or disagree with what they're saying.

Lecturer: How about taking notes during your trip? Any advice?

Mark: We spent quite a lot of time checking the terminology when we were doing our notes, but we should have left that till we got back. But at the end of each day on the field trip, you should look through your notes and make sure you can understand them, revising them if necessary.

Stella: And develop a logical system of file folders for your notes. You'll need to take notes of much more than you need. Don't write down just the things you know are important. When you're working with another student, you should both take notes to ensure a complete record.

Lecturer: Right. Well, it looks as if everything you...

SECTION 4

Good morning. In the second in my series of lectures, the Appliance of Science, I'm going to outline developments in plastics since the 1930s, focusing on the unique properties of the different discoveries and how they impact on so many aspects of our daily lives. It's hard to imagine what we do without plastics in their domestic application, and also, increasingly, for leisure pursuits.

Let's start with one of the earliest forms of plastics, polythene, which was invented in 1933. It essentially evolved into two forms. The first, low density polyethylene, better known as LDPE, is very flexible, and indeed this is probably its most significant feature and one which its developers recognize as important. This means that it's suitable for making things like film and also carrier bags and other packaging materials.

High density HDPE is more robust and it can be made more so by exposing it to a type of gas. It's particularly used for making rigid containers, for example for milk, or for household cleaners such as bleach.

But going back to the 1930s, another key development in plastics was polyurethane. It's still widely used in two forms. The first form is known as blown and this type is used in the manufacture of furniture for the padded parts. Blown polyurethane is also still widely used in the infrastructure of houses as a means of providing insulation in loft and roof spaces in particular. Polyurethane is also useful in its non blown form. It can be made into extremely comfortable and stretchy fibre, and nowadays it's widely used for sportswear.

Moving to the 1940s, there was another significant departure when polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, was developed. Its first application was in fabric under the brand names of Dacron and Terylene. In addition to being able to be made into fabric, PET has a valuable property of being particularly impermeable and is unaffected by carbonation, which tends to attack other plastics. So it's used in the manufacture of bottles for fizzy drinks and is therefore probably present in most of our fridges. PET is also very resistant to abrasion and for this reason it is used in the home for trays and other items that are often heavily scratched.

Turning now to the 1950s, which for many people was when plastic really impacted on their lives for the first time with a large number of new inventions and applications. One of the most visible parts of this plastics invasion was Earl Tupper's Tupperware, a line of sealable polyethylene food containers. The products were well designed and highly effective, greatly reducing spoilage of foods in storage. However, what Tupperware is probably best known for is the revolutionary techniques it's inventor developed for sales. He set up through a network of housewives who sold Tupperware as a means of bringing in extra money. For many people, this method was the first encounter they had with the product.

Finally, the 1960s. I'd like to finish by talking about a type of plastic which to my mind is one of the most versatile materials ever invented. Polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE, better known as Teflon. This is a non-stick material with hardly any friction, which can be deposited on metal surfaces as a protective coating. It was initially discovered by accident as long ago as 1938, but it took until the 1960s for Teflon non-stick frying pans to become an indispensable consumer item.

Teflon was later used to synthesize the so-called miracle fabric Gore-Tex. The best known use of this is for making rain wear and outdoor gear that in principle breathes to keep the wearers moisture from building up and so is particularly comfortable to wear for walking. However, Gore-Tex has other uses which are less well known. It is increasingly being used for making materials used for a variety of medical applications.

Now if anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer them...
