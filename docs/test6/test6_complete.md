Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Clifton Bird Park. I'm here today to talk about volunteer opportunities at the park.

First, let me stress the importance to Clifton Bird Park of birds that are now endangered. Our park plays a crucial role in conservation efforts for species that are at risk.

Now, for those interested in gardening, people who volunteer to help with gardening at the park need to come at least once a month. We need regular commitment to keep the gardens in good condition.

Who would be the ideal gardening volunteer? Well, according to my experience, someone who is willing to work in any weather would be perfect. Gardening can't stop just because it's raining or cold.

Our volunteer guides will mainly be working with international visitors. We get tourists from all over the world, and they really appreciate having knowledgeable local guides.

We're planning a Maintenance Day next month, and what is still required for this event is transport. We need volunteers who can help transport tools and materials around the park.

Now, let me show you around the park and point out some of our facilities...

### Part 3 听力原文

Janet: Hi Michael. I've been thinking about our marketing project on shampoo advertising.

Michael: Yes, it's interesting how shampoo marketing has evolved. What's your take on it?

Janet: Well, I think that over time, shampoo has become a different kind of commodity. It's moved from being a basic cleaning product to something that promises to transform your life.

Michael: That's true. What about the whole 'bad hair day' concept?

Janet: I actually think bad hair days really do exist - it's not just marketing. People genuinely feel different when their hair looks good or bad.

Michael: What do you think about the chemicals used in shampoos?

Janet: Well, the presence of the chemicals is rarely publicised. Most people don't know what sodium lauryl sulfate is, for example.

Michael: True. And what about packaging?

Janet: I've noticed that printing directly onto shampoo bottles, rather than onto labels, looks less attractive. Labels seem to give more flexibility for design.

Michael: For our environmental section, what should we focus on?

Janet: I think we should investigate variations in the weight of shampoo bottles. Some brands use much heavier plastic than others.

Michael: Good idea. What about your own shopping habits?

Janet: What about yours? What influences your decisions?

Michael: Honestly, my willingness to try new products. I get bored with the same brand and like experimenting.

Janet: Now, let's look at these advertisements. This Zing advert clearly focuses on an enviable lifestyle - successful people with perfect hair.

Michael: And this Splash one is all about romantic interest - the suggestion that using this shampoo will make you more attractive.

Janet: Just go seems to emphasize product reliability - the idea that you can depend on it to work.

Michael: And Brozene has a clear link to relaxation - using it is presented as a spa-like experience.

### Part 4 听力原文

Good afternoon. Today I want to talk about the benefits of using drama activities in the classroom.

Let me start with how drama contributes to a child's personal development.

When children participate in group activities, it develops confidence in their own ideas. They learn to express themselves and trust their creative instincts.

Unscripted, imaginative activities are particularly valuable because they allow children to take risks in a supportive environment. This builds their willingness to try new things.

Moving on to educational development, working as a group teaches the importance of listening to others. Children learn that everyone's contribution is valuable.

Also, performing makes children responsible for their learning and behavior. They understand that their actions affect the whole group's success.

Role-play can be used in many ways. It serves as a form of therapy for children experiencing problems. It helps them work through difficulties in a non-threatening way.

Role-play also helps children be objective about their behavior problems by seeing situations from different perspectives.

Teachers can use it to explore controversial issues with a class in a safe environment, where different viewpoints can be examined without real-world consequences.

It's also excellent for exploring children's self-knowledge and understanding of morality - what's right and wrong in different situations.

Now, let me focus on the advantages of using role-play specifically in the study of history.

First, drama activities increase children's participation in class. Instead of just reading about historical events, they become actively involved.

Role-play makes it easier for children to remember and understand historical events because they experience them emotionally, not just intellectually.

Finally, through drama, children can find answers to problems in history to see why certain decisions were made. They can explore the motivations and pressures that historical figures faced.

This active engagement with history creates lasting learning experiences that traditional teaching methods often can't achieve.
