### Part 2 听力原文

John: Good afternoon listeners. Thanks for tuning in to Four KB.

Jane Lewis is with us from Tourism Queensland to tell us about the annual Queensland festival.

Jane, welcome.

Jane: Morning John. So much is going on for the next couple of weeks in our festival here in the States capital of Brisbane.

The Music 10 opens this week and this will be an event not to be missed.

As the name suggests, the Music Tent is an enormous tent where musical performances and activities will be going on throughout the day for the next two weeks.

Monday is going to be really busy as it's a public holiday and the first day of the event.

It's going to be lots of fun.

But if you're free, it's probably a better option to leave it till Tuesday unless you love crowds - there will be fewer people then.

The following day is when the master classes take place and this requires preregistration so you can't just turn up I'm afraid.

The weekend educational workshops were so popular last year that they have been extended this year.

They now run each afternoon from 1 till 4 o'clock before the evening performances start from 5.

If you're learning to play an instrument, these workshops are great fun, so make sure you get along there.

Tickets for the music tend to events are available from the door or you can purchase them at the ticket office located in the city centre.

For the best deal though, take proof of your home address to any library.

As a local resident, you will be able to purchase discounted tickets - the tickets will be cheaper there.

Apart from music, we'll also be celebrating our local history with a special walking tour around Brisbane City Centre.

Not to be missed on the walk is a tour of Macquarie House, the home of Queensland's first governor.

It has lovely gardens you can walk around or picnic in.

This building has a fascinating history because it was built on the very same spot where the first settlers landed, so history lovers will find its location particularly interesting.

No Australian event is complete without a Barbie and I think the Big BBQ is going to be fantastic.

It's not quite as big as the Millennium year BBQ, but there'll be local and international bands playing on the main stage for the first time this year at no extra cost - there will be free entertainment.

As always, the food will be prepared by top local chefs.

My mouth is watering already.

I really recommend going along to the Railway Museum during the festival because trains are such an important part of Queensland's history.

On loan from Queensland Rail at the moment is our very first steam train.

You won't be able to see it in operation, but you can hop on board and have a meal in the old dining carriage.

There is also a wonderful display of uniforms that have been worn over the last 100 years.

Jane: Another really special opportunity is the return trip on our only remaining steam train, which runs from Ipswich to Toowoomba.

If you purchase a family ticket as well as a trip on the train, you'll receive a free Australian flag each to wave while aboard, and there's also a children's book included.

There is a small charge for the Ipswich Museum tour, but I think it's worth it as it makes an educational day out.

The documentary film you can see there is interesting, and it's well worth the $2 entry fee.

On the return train journey, the kids get a lovely activity book designed to teach them about the history of the steam train.

Don't forget to bring your sunscreen and hats, it's going to be hot up there in Toowoomba at this time of year.

And finally, I'm going to tell you about an event called Our Favorite Place.

This is an opportunity for the public to vote for their favorite spot anywhere in the state.

Maybe a park or a restaurant, it's up to you.

You can vote even if you're not living in the area at the moment.

You can vote as often as you like - people of any age may vote and you may vote several times by sending in the voting form or if you prefer, send a text message from any Australian mobile phone number with the name of the location. It's so easy.

Not much time left though, so get those votes in as soon as possible.

The winning location will be announced on the last Saturday of the festival.

Also remember that no age limit applies for this one, so this is a great way to get the whole family involved.

Well, thank you very much for that, Jane. Now we have music...

### Part 3 听力原文

Doctor Chang: Right, Jamie and Martha, tell me how the environmental science modules went for you both this term.

Jamie: Well, let's start with Statistics for environmental research. I found it was too basic to be useful - I already knew most of the content from my undergraduate degree.

Martha: I agree. It didn't really add much to what we already knew.

Doctor Chang: What about Sewage and drainage systems?

Martha: That one was surprisingly interesting. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it, but the lecturer made it really engaging.

Jamie: Yes, I thought so too. Much better than I anticipated.

Doctor Chang: And Agriculture and food security?

Jamie: That module included out-of-date materials. Some of the case studies were from the 1990s, which isn't very relevant to current issues.

Martha: True, but the core concepts were still useful.

Doctor Chang: What about Sustainable energy?

Martha: That involved practical applications, which was great. We got to visit wind farms and solar installations.

Jamie: Yes, the practical side really helped us understand the theory better.

Doctor Chang: Government policy?

Jamie: I felt it seemed too limited geographically - it focused mainly on UK policy and didn't cover international perspectives enough.

Martha: I had the same concern. More global examples would have been helpful.

Doctor Chang: And finally, Water management?

Martha: That provided unnecessary detail in some areas. Too much focus on technical specifications that we didn't really need.

Jamie: Agreed. It could have been more streamlined.

Doctor Chang: Overall, what did you both like about the course organization?

Jamie: I really liked the range of different modules offered - there was something for everyone's interests.

Martha: Yes, and the relevance of the module content to current environmental issues was excellent.

Doctor Chang: Anything you'd change about the written assignments?

Jamie: I think discussions with fellow students should be arranged - it would help us develop our ideas.

Martha: Absolutely. And the time for choosing a topic should be changed - we need more time to think about what we want to research.

### Part 4 听力原文

Good morning, everyone. Today I'm going to talk about a fascinating phenomenon called photic sneezing.

Some people have an unusual reaction to sunlight. When they're exposed to bright light, they experience a prickle in the nose, followed by faster breathing which is typically relieved by a sneeze, and often watery eyes as well.

This 'photic' sneeze cannot be controlled and is actually a common reflex that affects about 25% of the population.

Let me explain sneezing in general first. A sneeze is caused by some kind of irritation in the nose. When this happens, nerve endings in the face are stimulated, leading to an explosion of air. Interestingly, sneezing is coordinated by the same mechanism that controls the production of tears.

Research into photic sneezing goes back thousands of years. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle asked an interesting question: Why does the sun cause sneezing while a fire does not? This was one of the earliest recorded observations of the phenomenon.

Much later, Francis Bacon showed that the cause was definitely light, not heat from the sun.

More recently, researcher Everett found that 80% of photic sneezers shared the habit with relatives, suggesting a genetic component.

There are some interesting indicators of photic sneezing. People who experience this usually produce the same number of sneezes each time - typically two or three in succession.

The reaction is caused by a contrast in brightness - moving from a dark environment to a bright one, rather than just being in bright light.

After sneezing, there's a refractory period - the sneeze mechanism takes time to recharge before it can be triggered again.

For a long time, this condition was often ignored by researchers, apart from some research on photic sneezing among pilots, where it could potentially be dangerous during flight.

However, studying this seemingly minor condition may result in breakthroughs for understanding more serious neurological conditions.
