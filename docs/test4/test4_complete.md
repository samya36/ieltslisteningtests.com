Official: Right, volunteers, thank you all for coming to this briefing for the annual beach races. Let me start with some general information about the event.

This year we're expecting even more participants than last year. The most popular race is still the old tractors - they always draw the biggest crowds and the most participants.

Now, regarding the horse race, I need to stress that it's very important that you keep the finish line clear. We've had problems in the past with spectators getting too close.

The Beach Picnic this year is only for children - we're trying to create a special family-friendly area.

Regarding parking, despite rising costs everywhere else, parking costs the same as last year - we've managed to keep it at $5 per vehicle.

For those of you managing the stall area, please remember that all stall-holders need to display a council licence. This is a legal requirement, so please check this carefully.

Finally, my advice to all volunteers - it's going to be a long, hot day, so eat and drink regularly. We don't want anyone fainting on us!

Now, let me show you where the various facilities will be located...

John: Hi Annie. Have you seen this article about gender marketing of toys and clothes?

Annie: Yes, it's fascinating. According to the article, UK retailers who differentiate between boys' and girls' products are being forced to change this approach due to consumer pressure.

John: That's interesting. What do you think about how toys are displayed in stores?

Annie: Well, I believe most parents prefer children's toys to be displayed according to age group rather than gender. It makes more practical sense.

John: I've been reading Lise Eliot's book on gender roles. What did you think of it?

Annie: I thought Eliot makes some valid points within the book, especially about how early these gender distinctions start.

John: Yes, and in my opinion, the problem of marketing toys according to gender is that a child's career options could become limited. If girls don't play with building blocks, they might not develop spatial skills needed for engineering.

Annie: That's a good point. The article also had that interesting flow-chart about clothing...

John: Right, about how it was because of practical reasons that children wore white clothes in the 19th century - white was easy to bleach clean.

Annie: And then in the early 1900s, consumers were influenced by the choices of well-known figures, like celebrities and royalty.

John: By the 1940s, shop owners believed that parental preferences were 'blue for boys' and 'pink for girls'.

Annie: Then in the 1960s, teenage girls believed that unisex styles could be beneficial to them - it was part of the feminist movement.

John: And the advertising changes of the 1980s meant that people felt pressure to shop for gender-specific clothing.

Annie: Nowadays, some mothers want their daughters to have feminine clothes as they did not have these themselves when they were growing up.

Good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll be talking about the fascinating history of umbrellas.

Throughout history, umbrellas have held great symbolic meaning. For rulers and people in positions of authority, umbrellas symbolized power, showcasing their authority and status in society.

In ancient Rome, interestingly, only wealthy Roman women could own umbrellas - they were considered a status symbol of femininity and luxury.

Looking at materials and construction, different cultures used different materials. In India, umbrellas were made from local wood, while in China they were made from silk, which was readily available there.

To improve their functionality, umbrellas were treated with wax to make them waterproof, greatly improving their usefulness in wet weather.

Originally, umbrellas were designed to protect the body from various elements - not just rain, but sun and wind as well.

Early umbrellas were quite different from what we see today. They resembled big lids, providing extensive coverage but were quite cumbersome.

In harsh weather conditions, umbrellas were often used with gloves, especially in cold or wet climates, as people needed to protect their hands while holding them.

The introduction of plastic in the 1850s was revolutionary - it made umbrellas lighter and more durable than ever before.

In England, umbrella frames began to be made with steel, which greatly enhanced their durability and ability to withstand strong winds.

Finally, in Germany, the shift to using nylon for umbrella fabric improved their functionality and popularity, as nylon was both lightweight and water-resistant.
